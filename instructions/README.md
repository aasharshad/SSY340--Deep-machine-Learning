# Instructions
This directory holds guides for various tools / environments that will be used throughout the course. They may make most sense to read in the order they are numbered, but also hold some cross-references to each other.

### A couple of notes on the cloud providers
As you can see, there are separate cloud instructions for Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. Both options have their strengths and limitations, and ideally you will only have to choose one of them. We recommend that you try Azure, if possible.
- For Azure, we unfortunately do not have any free credits to hand out to you (as we do for Google Cloud). Instead, this solution relies on you registering to Azure's personal student offer, which is actually quite generous.
- Google Cloud might suffer from some availability issues. That is, even if you have configured a virtual machine to be run in the cloud, at the time you want to connect to it, it might not be available for you. Although this could potentially happen for both providers, we expect the risk to be higher for Google Cloud. Naturally, due to these circumstances, the Google solution might require more flexibility regarding your time.

You are advised, **as early as possible**, to follow Step 1. of **both** sets of cloud instructions (i.e. instruction files starting with `02a` and `02b`, this is not very time consuming) in order to minimize the possibility of not having access to a cloud machine.
